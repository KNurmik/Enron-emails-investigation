[Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron) was an American Energy company which was founded in 1985 by Kenneth Lay. In 2001, it was revealed that Enron had been performing systematic accounting fraud, which lead to multiple lawsuits and indictments. As a result of this, Enron filed for bankruptcy in October 2001.

This project was created as part of JSC370: Data Science II at the University of Toronto by Karl Hendrik Nurmeots and Samuel Vedrik. The starter code for the project was created by David Duvenaud and Harsh Panchal. This project uses a dataset of emails sent and received by the top executives of Enron from 1999 to 2002.

For this project we are assuming the roles of investigators who have suspicions about Enron's doings, and we want to obtain a better understanding of what, if any, wrongdoing has occurred. While our suspicions have merit (and, of course, we have knowledge of wrongdoing in retrospect), it is important to treat everyone involved as innocent until proven guilty.

The purpose of this project was to utilize topic modelling and network analysis techniques to highlight suspicious persons, emails or topics that should be investigated further.
